# Get coefficients from the orthogonalized regressions

Get coefficients from the orthogonalized regressions

## Usage

``` r
OrthoReg_JLL(JLLinputs, N, FacSet, FactorLab_NonOrth, FactorLab_JLL)
```

## Arguments

- JLLinputs:

  List of necessary inputs to estimate JLL-based setups

- N:

  number of country-specific spanned factors (scalar)

- FacSet:

  Set of factors used in the estimation of JLL-based setups

- FactorLab_NonOrth:

  Variable labels of the non-orthogonalized risk factors

- FactorLab_JLL:

  Variable labels of the orthogonalized risk factors
