## Resubmission
This is a re-submission. In this version I have:


* updated the package vignette titled *MultiATSM package - General Guidelines* so it now describes more accurately the  outputs generated by the *LoadData()* function;
* modified the reference to the paper of Candelon and Moura (2024) in the package's description, since this paper is now currently published.
